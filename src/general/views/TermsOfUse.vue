          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

          DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
          online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will

          have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method
